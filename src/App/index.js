            <li>
              The importance of spreading awareness in our communities about their responsibilities towards human and civil work and communicating with officials and decision-makers, especially members of Congress in their electoral constituencies. The prosperity of democracy, human rights and the rule of law requires the activity of members of the community and all citizens of Libya
              <br/><br/>
              The human rights education and training can be a key component of national peacebuilding. The range of human rights activities associated with truth, reconciliation and transitional justice, the national and international activities designed to support the rebuilding of the national government, its institutions and social services, as well as other activities directed towards reestablishing the national economy. Within this complex, human rights education is typically unique because it alone focuses on the daily lives of the citizenry at large.

              <b><i>Democracy and Human Rights</i></b>
              <br/><br/>
              In general principle, promoting democracy and supporting human rights are interrelated, interdependent, and inseparable concepts.  Although democratic societies can protect and advance human rights better than other forms of government, nevertheless the promotion of human rights even under repressive regimes or conflict can advance their transformation toward democracy.
              <br/><br/>
              Therefore, the Libyan American Human Rights Organization will seek to conduct several workshops in this field in ten American cities.
              <br/><br/>
              It is also seeking to set up these workshops in Tunisia since Amnesty International agreed to participate in these workshops.
              <br/><br/>
